Installation
============

Include the static from extension called `PP-Gridelements w/DataProcessing`.

In case the extension `pizpalue` is used the static `PP-Gridelements - Pizpalue` can be included too. This will enable
automatic width calculations for image rendering.

.. attention::

   In case the site is using the extension `pizpalue` and the static `PP-Gridelements - Pizpalue` is added the field
   `Image scaling` in the `Image` tab from the content elements should be reviewed. Since the image dimensions are
   now calculated automatically the default values might need to be restored.
